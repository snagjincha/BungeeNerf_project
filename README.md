# BungeeNerf_project


This is an industry-academia project conducted by Professor Na Seung-Hoon's four undergraduate research students. (차상진, 임정민, 정재호, 최우찬)

We ran it by referring to this GitHub(https://github.com/city-super/BungeeNeRF) and conducted the first training due to GPU capacity issues.

Additional renderings would allow us to see a more enlarged and detailed view of Manhattan.

This is the video that is the result of rendering.
